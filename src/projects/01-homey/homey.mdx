  ### Userflow and style guide
  Style guide are derived from iOS guideline which was based on clarity on elements, deference in motion and hierarchy and facilitate understanding while applying my research on previous portfolio project.

  Clash colour scheme is mainly used for the design process with an analogous color scheme as extra colours.  

  The colours picked for this study are lively and vibrant that set the mood for love, passion, and futuristic for smart home applications. The midnight blue and light grey are used to take place the black and white to make it less serious. Purple serves as an accent colour that can be used as the main colour when in dark mode. Extra colours are used to create more vibrance and liveliness. It is also used to showcase classification on a graph.

  #### Typography

  Runda is a neo-grotesque typeface that offers contemporary designs. Runda was used in the entire typeset. Though it has only 4 families, it was good enough to cater to the applications without making complicated guidelines for future use.

  #### Iconography
  <MdxImage imageDirectory="homey-iconography" imageDescription="Homey Iconography"/>

  Icons used are geometrically done in an outline style on a unified scale based on Material Design Icons. Icons change colour depending on the state they are in such as pressed disabled and default state.

  #### Components
