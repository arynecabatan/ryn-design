World Heritage – UNESCO List is a mobile application that was developed by the Appworldheritage. It is available in both Android and iOS without limiting to phone and tablet. It features a list of UNESCO World Heritage sites by countries and years. It also features sites near your area, wishlist, and visited places. They added an interactive map and a booking button that transfer you to Booking.com.

Problem: Though World Heritage – UNESCO List is a good app in terms of information and content. In terms of audience perspective, the application’s UI is poorly done (iconography, typography, colours, and even style guide). The content is inconsistent and cluttered that makes the application overwhelming.

  - **Overview:** In this project, I redesign an existing mobile application. I focused on user experience and organizing the application interface. Additional research on motion interaction is applied.
  - **Constraint:** Four weeks deadline, a cross-platform design that works between Android and iOS.
  - **Platform:** Android OS

  ### Userflow and style guide

  The style guide is adapted from Google’s Material Design guidelines and also it applies an experience that will work for iOS devices as the application is cross-platform.

  #### Colour
  
  Achromatic colour scheme with an accent colour of teal and small detail of red.

  The use of white as the dominant color acts as the base colour of the app. Default icons are coloured in Grey 400 to show hierarchy. The typography is composed of black text for legibility reasons. The main colour, teal is to give life to the user experience through interactions. Lastly, the use of red is to compliment teal for the wish micro-interactions.

  The cherry colour is picked from Google Material.

  The teal associate with calmness and adventure. It is also the colour of nature. The red on the other hand is associated with love and passion. Mainly used by travel agencies as their colour.

  #### Typography

  Roboto is famous for being the default font used by the Android system. Roboto has a semi-big family, though just an average family it has the essential weights from light to black.

  Throughout the redesign, the medium and regular are only used. The medium is used for headline and readability, the latter is used for the body.

  Sized used for the title is 20 and the body is 14.

  #### Iconography

  #### Components

  #### Logo

  Similar to every mobile application this application’s redesigned logo is composed of the pictorial mark. Since dealing with Android as a primary design, I came up with a logo that does not bleed and can work on the Android adaptive icon system. 

  Also, the keyline provided by google is used to guide the bounding of the logo.

  Moving to the logo design, the logo is composed of outlined letters W and H which stands for World Heritage. And tangled them to make a pin shape that mainly a symbol for travel and tour.

  The app also used curves and rounded corners opposing the straight edges which are aggressive.
